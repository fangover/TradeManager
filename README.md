# ðŸ“ˆ TradeManager

**TradeManager** is an automated trading system I'm developing on MetaTrader 5. 
As a beginner, Iâ€™m exploring my own ideas for managing risk and executing multiple trading strategies in Forex. 
This project is purely for learning and experimentation. 
Iâ€™m building something I enjoy, not intended for real trading or financial use
